    "[In the examining room, Danny snipes about the father of Jordan's baby.]\nJordan: This is the time for a lecture?\nDanny: No, that was about twelve weeks ago.

Should have trusted me a little, Danny.\nMatt: [to Danny] Sorry about that, that one was all me.\nDanny: Yeah.\nMatt: [turning to everyone] Ironically, I'm the one who's high as a paper kite right now.

Because your Canadian accent...\nTom: Too much?\nAndy: It was Mexican.\nTom: This is the longest they've ever taken to decide.\nAndy: In the old days, if your sketch didn't make it on the air, they used to send you downstairs naked, to sell lemon drinks shrouded only in your failure.

No, I know it seems like this is supposed to be funny, but tomorrow you're gonna find out that it wasn't and by that time I'll have been fired. No, this is... this is not... this is not a sketch. This show used to be cutting edge political and social satire, but it's gotten lobotomized by a candy-ass broadcast network hell-bent on doing nothing that might challenge their audience. We're about to do a sketch that you've seen already about 500 times. Yeah, no one's gonna confuse George Bush with George Plimpton. Yeah, we get it. We're all being lobotomized by this country's most influential industry that's just throwing in the towel on any endeavor to do anything that doesn't include the courting of 12 year old boys.
